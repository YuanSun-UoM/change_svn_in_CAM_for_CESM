Lookat_NudgeWindow
======================

Lookat_NudgeWindow is an NCL program to preview window settings in 
the 'nudging_nl' namelist before comitting to a run. 

Prior to use, a shared library for the Read_Namelist.f90 interface must
be compiled using NCL WRAPIT:
  
     prompt> WRAPIT Read_Namelist.f90 Read_Namelist.stub
 
     WRAPIT Version: 120209
     COMPILING Read_Namelist.f90
     LINKING
     END WRAPIT

The script is configured for a default iof 32 model levels and assumes that
there is a user_nl_cam file with the desired window settings in the current 
directory. The number of model levels can be specified on the command line 
with the 'NLEV' varaible. 

     prompt> ncl Lookat_NudgeWindow.ncl             ! Default 32 levels

     prompt> ncl NLEV=60 Lookat_NudgeWindow.ncl     ! For 60 level model.

The script by default will pop up a blank window. Clicking on the window
or hitting return in the command window will display the horizontal 
nudginig window in a lat,lon map as well as longitude/latitude profiles
of the window. Clicking again, or hitting return again, will display the
profile for the vertical window. A final click will exit the program.
